	With chamel back in the game, v0.5 is now back on track! I finally got rid of that load/save feature and 
	a few updates later, the future release is ready to be packaged. This week is the target!

	One step forward to v0.5 with the ability to run research on weapons and mods. Everything should work
	as in the original game. Now, I'm working on the load/save functionnality and I hope to complete it
	by the end of April (don't look at previous news).
	
	Next to it, I'm planning to reorganize the SVN repository a little bit. The idea is to keep the trunk directory
	only for freesynd source code. All other directories will go one level up, the first will be the www directory.

	After quite a long period of inactivity, Freesynd development has started again. Holidays, new year's eve resolutions
	have delayed the release of the v0.5 version. On top of that, we lost one of our contributor : chamel. See you!
	
	I'm planning to release v0.5 at the end of March. The goal of this version is to complete all work on menus so that
	future development will be focused on the gameplay. Next stop : end of march!

	<item title="New v0.4 release" date="2010-09-27" author="Benoit Blancard">
The v0.4 development release is now available from [[https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=93282 sourceforge]]. Again,
this release contains mainly bug fixes and enhancement. Read the release notes to have a complete view of the work done.

This release and the next ones won't contain the original data files because of licence restrictions. 
So you'll have to download the original game to use its data files (use -p option to specify the new data path when launching the game).

Enjoy!
